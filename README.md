# 🐍 Python Fundamentals & Project-Basics Learning (PBL)

## 💡 About This Repository

This repository documents my structured learning path through **Python Fundamentals** based on a custom 4-week curriculum. All code examples, exercises, and mini-projects are stored here.

### My Learning Philosophy (PBL Approach)

I believe in learning by doing. My approach is centered on:

1.  **Problem First :** Before writing code, I identify a real-world problem or a conceptual challenge that requires the specific topic (e.g., using `for` loops to solve a repetition need).
2.  **Coding as Study:** All learning materials are translated into functional code solutions, allowing me to fully grasp the 'why' and 'how' through active coding.
3.  **Open Documentation:** Progress notes, conceptual explanations, and detailed breakdowns are shared externally on my DEV Blog (see link below) to solidify understanding.

## ⏭️ Full-Stack Transition: My Next 11-Week Curriculum
Following the successful completion of Python fundamentals, my learning path shifts sharply toward practical Full-Stack Web Development. 
This curriculum is designed on a Problem-Based Learning (PBL) model to build a robust, production-ready portfolio.
